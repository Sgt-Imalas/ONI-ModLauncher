## Features
- Organize your mod list outside of the game with the ability to save and load backups of your mod lists.
- Toggle between Vanilla and DLC outside of the game.
- Enable Debug Mode with a simple checkbox.
- Enable a hidden testing feature that skips the main menu and immediately loads the last save file.
- Open and edit JSON config files for mods.
- Mod Sorting (For now this just sorts alphanumerically with local/dev folder mods at the top)
